# CV-Presentation
A copy of my code from my computer vision presentation that has a demo of object detection as well as k means clustering

**This version will be built on Python3.11**

This is a copy of all the important information from my presentation on computer vision in my senior class. It has a copy of my presentation along with a bibliography


The main purpose of this branch to track building a stereo vision setup with basic object detection built on color mapping first. The tools will be built up from my old senior project files and expanded to handle both opject detection and distance to target.

TODO: Write up short summary of what every file does along with any notes about what the math is.

I'm bored of the lorem ipsum text so I'm just putting random stuff here for the same purpose.
